## General rules

<span id="1"></span>
**1.** The development of new versions occurs in the
_[dev](https://www.github.com/mayconfmelo/min-book/tree/dev/)_ branch

<span id="2"></span>
**2.** The _[main](https://www.github.com/mayconfmelo/min-book/tree/main/)_ 
branch contains (roughly) the last version published in Typst Universe.

<span id="3"></span>
**3.** All pull requests should contain at least one brief code example when it 
introduces any API changes (arguments, commands, structure, _etc_.)

<span id="4"></span>
**4.** If you want to directly help in development, your pull request will be
more than welcome.

<span id="5"></span>
**5.** If you have any suggestion, feature request, bug to report, or found
outdated documentation, please open a
[new issue](https://github.com/mayconfmelo/min-book/issues/new/choose).

<span id="6"></span>
**6.** Each issue _must_ attend to one and only one subject, but you can open as
many issues as needed.

<span id="7"></span>
**7.** If you have a question, or want to showcase your code, or say anything
else, please use the [Discussions](https://github.com/mayconfmelo/min-book/discussions)
tab.

<span id="8"></span>
**8.** The documentation is gathered from special comments inside the code itself; all
Typst code inside `/** **/` or `///` comments will appear in the manual.

## Guidelines

We are very grateful for all community contribution received, be they
pull requests, issues, or even thoughtfull insights, big or small. If you want
to be part of it and help the project, please consider the following general
notions:

**Point out a problem:**  
To work is to solve problems, and it's not different in colaborative work;
explain in a succinct but detailed way what went wrong, all problems, bugs,
and/or errors that motivated your contribution.

**Explain the solution desired or obtained:**  
Where there is a problem, there is a solution; even if you do not know how to
achieve it, you will at least know what behavior or result was expected. Be clear
and concise to describe how things should happen.

**Consider alternatives:**  
There is more than one way to do it, no matter what it is; sometimes, there are
other paths to take or alternative to consider. Describe other approaches tried
or considered in a brief way, they can be powerful insights to speed up
development.

**Additional information may be valuable:**  
Sometimes the problem is where we least imagine; peripheral but related data can
point to crucial information or show paths to understand problems. Do
not ignore them. But do not get too excited also, there is always a giant quantity
of additional information about everything, use common sense to filter them out.

**Be assertive:**  
Not always big data is great data; there is no need to write an entire book to
explain something in detail. One honest-sized paragraph and/or lists of brief
topics are good enough.

**Be nice!**  
Only the respectability of old age gives you the right to be grumpy; we are
really glad for all voluntary contributions received, and we also work
volhntarily in this project, no need to anyone act like a boss. Furthermore,
being nice is so nice!
